### Fuse-box + Vue.js

This project is to get you started using FuseBox as module loader and bundler with Vue.js, using `TypeScript`

This Project shows how we can use `Vue` with `FuseBox`  in two ways. one using `Vue` single file component and the other using typical  `Vue` component.

We leverage `FuseBox` `HTML` plugin to show how we can Bundle and Load `Vue` template as `HTML` file, we also use `FuseBox` `SASS` plugin to show how we can import any `SASS` file in code and `FuseBox` will inject it in the page like any other `CSS`.
